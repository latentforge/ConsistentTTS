## Model Description

**Chroma 1.0** is an advanced multimodal model developed by **[FlashLabs](https://flashlabs.ai)**. It is designed to understand and generate content across multiple modalities, including text and audio. As a virtual human model, Chroma possesses the ability to process auditory inputs and respond with both text and synthesized speech, enabling natural voice interactions.

- **Model Type:** Multimodal Causal Language Model
- **Developed by:** FlashLabs
- **Language(s):** English
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Model Architecture:** 
  - **Reasoner:** Based on Qwen2.5-Omni-3B
  - **Backbone:** Based on Llama3 (16 layers, 2048 hidden size)
  - **Decoder:** Based on Llama3 (4 layers, 1024 hidden size)
  - **Codec:** Mimi (24kHz sampling rate)

## Model Architecture

## Capabilities

Chroma 1.0 is capable of:
- **Speech Understanding:** Processing user audio input directly.
- **Multimodal Generation:** Generating coherent text and speech responses simultaneously.
- **Voice Cloning:** utilizing reference audio prompts to guide speech generation style.

## Usage

### Installation

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need the latest versions of `transformers` and `torch`.

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Loading the Model

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

model_id = "FlashLabs/Chroma-4B" # Or local path

# Load model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id, 
    trust_remote_code=True, 
    device_map="auto"
)

# Load processor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
```

### Inference Example

Here is how to perform a simple conversation with audio input and audio output:

```python
import torch
from IPython.display import Audio



# Construct conversation history
system_prompt = (
    "You are Chroma, an advanced virtual human created by the FlashLabs. "
    "You possess the ability to understand auditory inputs and generate both text and speech."
)
conversation = [[
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": system_prompt}
        ],
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            # Input audio file path
            {"type": "audio", "audio": "assets/make_taco.wav"}, 
        ],
    },
]]

# Provide reference audio/text for style or context
prompt_text = ["War and bloodshed throughout the world."]
prompt_audio = ["assets/reference_audio.wav"]

# Process inputs
inputs = processor(
    conversation,
    add_generation_prompt=True, 
    tokenize=False,
    prompt_audio=prompt_audio,
    prompt_text=prompt_text
)

# Move inputs to device
device = model.device
inputs = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in inputs.items()}

# 2. Generate
output = model.generate(
    **inputs, 
    max_new_tokens=100, 
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    use_cache=True
)

# 3. Decode Audio
# The model outputs raw tokens; we decode the audio part using the codec
audio_values = model.codec_model.decode(output.permute(0, 2, 1)).audio_values

# Save or play audio (e.g., in Jupyter)
Audio(audio_values[0].cpu().detach().numpy(), rate=24_000)
```
